# Help Farah 🏃‍♀️💨

**Crossing the road has never been this stressful.**

Welcome to *Help Farah*, my first attempt at a Crossy Road–style game… but with a twist: instead of a chicken, we have Farah — and yes, the cars are just as aggressive as you’d imagine.

This is an **early prototype**, so be gentle. Bugs may bite. Cars may bully. But it’s all part of the fun! 😅

---

## How to Play

* **Move Farah** using arrow keys on desktop or swipe gestures on mobile.
* **Goal:** Avoid cars and trucks while crossing as many lanes as you can.
* **Score:** How far Farah can survive without becoming roadkill.

---

## Features

* Randomly generated lanes (forest, road, and… some cars that don’t like Farah)
* Collision detection that keeps the game honest
* Score counter to humble you after every run
* Retry button, because Farah is resilient (and you’ll need it)

---

## Tech Stack

* **HTML / CSS / JS** (Vanilla, because why complicate fun?)
* **Three.js** for some 3D vibes
* Runs in your browser, no chicken sacrifices required

---

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:husaynali/help-farah.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Avoid the cars.
4. Celebrate when Farah survives another lane.

## Next Steps

* Add sound effects (because Farah deserves dramatic music)
* More obstacles and vehicle types
* Maybe a leaderboard… if Farah gets famous
